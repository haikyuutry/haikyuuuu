                        Vision and Mission
                    </div>
                    <p>We do hope that the website continues to grow over time and to please haikyu!! fans in the future. The vision of this website is to provide relatable informations around the haikyu!! world and to provide affordable haikyu!! products. From the beginning, our mission has always been to grow the haikyu!! family. With the show fame, a fandom occur and we want the fandom to be a family where we can share about anything related to haikyu!! and not feel weird or awkward. We are aware that not much people really have the friend to talk about haikyu!! and here we want to provide that.</p>

                        Reason and Journey
                    </div>
                    <p>As mentioned in the Vision and Mission section, we want to be the haikyu!! friend you didn't have. We want to be that insightful and discussful friend to anyone who need it. The journey started when a task on website development was assigned. It took quite some mistakes to finally be able to finish the website. Constant change of design was stressful as the most of the time we didn't meet the expectation. We had to lower my expectations down and started working on a rather simpler website than the first expectation we had. We had to cut the material included as the time was running out fast. The journey and process of this website making was fun and stressful in many ways but we are grateful that it is finally done.</p>
